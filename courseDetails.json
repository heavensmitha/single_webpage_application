Prior to 12.6 I had no problems downloading any podcasts.  I've tried 6-8 different podcasts on iTunes and can't download podcasts from any of them.  I've had to go to each individual website and download it from there, but this is really time consuming and annoying to do.  I've tried to log a problem downloading podcast entry on iTunes but my request would not post and still could not download the podcast.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
